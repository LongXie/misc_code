# This is a LUT in which the segmentation name is simply "SegXXXX"
# where XXXX is the segmentation number. This can be handy for
# when you are visualizing segmentations that have been generated
# by a process in which segmentation names are not easily 
# generated (eg, clustering). The colors are the same order as in 
# FreeSurferColor.txt.
